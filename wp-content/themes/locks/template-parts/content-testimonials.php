<div class="item"><p>“I needed a key made for an antique jewelry box. After calling several locksmiths in Houston, I finally found what I was looking for at King Safe and Lock. I knew the second I walked in the door that this Houston locksmith would be able to make my unique key. The locksmith used the utmost caution with my jewelry box and was able to provide me with a key in minutes. They even showed me around the safe shop and showroom and made a few suggestions for jewelry safes and fire safes without being pushy. Thank you, King Safe and Lock, for caring about the protection of my valuables!” </p></div>

My friends are all convinced that I do it on purpose just to have an excuse to visit my favorite locksmith in Houston! I really keep going back because the wonderfully low price on high security computer chip keys. They charge half of what dealers charge! They are always very quick and courteous. Thanks yet again for saving my sanity, King Safe and Lock! See you next week!” </p></div>
